Welcome to the 2D Skateboarding Autoscroller game! 
This is a budget Tony Hawk's pro skater game.

Your goal is to get the highest possible score before hitting the finish line,
	while avoiding getting hit by any rail obstacles or pesky pedestrians.

Controls and points are as follows:
Spacebar: Jump
A - Ollie, 1 point
B - Backside Heelflip, 3 points
C - 50/50 Grind, 2 points
D - Feeble Grind, 3 points
E - Backflip, 4 points
F - Helicopter, 6 points

Each trick has a different risk:reward ratio. More risk corresponds to more reward.
	Failing that trick will deduce the same number of points it gives for succeeding!

Best of luck. My high score is a 46!
